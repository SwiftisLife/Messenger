# Messenger
**JSQMessagesViewController** and **Firebase** combined to create a real-time database messenger.

* This project utilizes Firebase version 3.11.1

**Use Swift Legacy Language Version**

# Pods used in this project:
```
 pod 'JSQMessagesViewController', '7.3.4'
 pod 'Firebase/Core'
 pod 'Firebase/Database'
 pod 'Firebase/Auth'
```

# Using Firebase in your project:
* Create a new project in your Firebase console (console.firebase.google.com).
* Add Firebase to your iOS app by following the directions in the 'Project Settings Tab'.
* Download and add the GoogleService-Info.plist for your application.
* Remove the original GoogleService-Info.plist in the project file by deleting it and replacing it with your own.

**Not using your own GoogleService-Info.plist file will result in not being able to control and use your database as this application is using my own database on Firebase!**
